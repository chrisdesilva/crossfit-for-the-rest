Never say never

“There’s no way in hell you’ll ever get me to step foot in a CrossFit gym.”

 I spoke those words, verbatim, about three years ago. And, as you’ve probably guessed thanks to the name of this blog, I was wrong. Quite wrong. 

These days, I go to CrossFit at least four times a week (five if I’m feeling ambitious and my schedule allows). I recently had to buy a bigger duffel bag to fit my three pairs of CrossFit shoes, grips, lifting belt, and jump rope. (And yes, sometimes I use all of the above in a single WOD).

I’m addicted.  I love it.  CrossFit is a big part of my life and I am a happier, healthier person because of it. 

And sometimes, just like David Byrne, I ask myself, “How did I get here?” 


Let me start at the beginning. 

Growing up I had zero athletic ability.  My parents, bless their hearts, tried enrolling me in just about every sport- soccer, softball, basketball, even badminton.  And I hated it all. I sucked.  At everything.  The people around me made athletics look so easy, and that intimidated me.  I was embarrassed by what I couldn’t do and anxious that I was going to mess up or get hurt.  I was a skinny little girl with knock-knees and toothpicks for arms. As a result, I developed a pretty negative attitude toward fitness. 

Sometime after college, I discovered yoga.  Finally, a form of exercise that I didn’t suck at or hate!  I went through yoga teacher training and taught for about a year at a well-known yoga studio in Austin, Texas.  

And then I moved.  

My husband, Chris, and I decided to buy a house in the small-ish town of Bastrop, about 30 miles east of Austin.  Lucky for him, the owners of his CrossFit gym in Austin also had a box in Bastrop.  He would tell me about the gruelling workouts and show me the open tears on his palms. To which I said, “No thanks.”
 But he also talked about the sense of community, how encouraging and welcoming everyone was. And that it was actually...fun.   

But I was still very anti-CrossFit. I pictured a bunch of sweaty meatheads chest-bumping each other, grunting and screaming while they threw comically large barbells around.  I thought all of the women would look jacked yet gorgeous, and that I would be out of place, self-conscious, and physically unable to do any of the workouts. 

I had the picture of a stereotypical “CrossFitter” in my head and I saw nothing that I could relate to or attain. 

I said, “There’s no way in hell you’ll ever get me to step foot in a CrossFit gym.” 

For the next few months, I struggled to find a way to stay fit while living in Bastrop.  The commute to-and-from my yoga studio in Austin got to be too tiring and expensive.  There weren’t any other good local options.  I tried going to one of the local gyms but found their group exercise classes to be lacking and unengaging. (And I definitely don’t have to self-discipline to work out on my own.) 

Chris, meanwhile, kept nudging me to give CrossFit a try.  “No one looks like that,” he said after I described who I was picturing.  Most of the members, he told me, were just a bunch of Average Joes who were just trying to stay in shape or maybe lose weight.  

Eventually, because there were no other options, I gave in.  

Going to my first class at CrossFit Strive Bastrop was incredibly intimidating.  I was nervous that I would make a fool of myself or get hurt. I pictured myself dropping a barbell on my head or something embarrassing like that. 

While I waited for the previous class to finish, I looked around the gym.  Yes, a few of the people working out were clearly in good shape.  But most didn’t look at all like what I was picturing. 

They were all shapes, sizes, and ages, but they all had one thing in common: they were all working their asses off. 

I remember seeing one grey-haired lady using a box to help with a pull-up modification.  And I said to myself, “If she can do CrossFit, I can do CrossFit.” 

After my first few classes, I found that I was right about a few things.  There was a lot that I couldn’t do.  I had thought that because I did yoga and was relatively thin, I was “in shape.”  But that didn’t equate to physical strength. I could barely hold myself in a dead hang on the pull-up bar. The regular barbell was much too heavy for me, and for weeks I was stuck with the puny, 15-pound trainer bar (or the “baby bar” as I called it.)  I had to scale the scaled workouts. 

But I was also wrong about a lot. There was a lot that I could do.  The coaches helped me with modifications without making me feel like an idiot. I didn’t drop a barbell on my head.  No looked at me like I was a failure or a loser.  In fact, everyone was really nice. I wasn’t lifting nearly the weight that they were and I was usually the slowest to finish a WOD. But they could tell that I, like them, was working my ass off.  And that was all that mattered. 

After weeks of feeling more sore than I ever thought possible, I found myself getting stronger. I eventually graduated from the “baby bar” to the “big girl bar.” I remember the first WOD where I was finally able to do the actual scaled weight, instead of scaling the scaled.  My arms, no longer toothpicks, developed some muscle definition. 

Another thing I remember telling myself is, “I’ll never be able to climb the rope.”  I just never thought it would be possible for me.  But guess what? I can do it! It took me over a year, but now I actually look forward to days with rope climbs in the Metcon. (I’m still very much afraid of heights and have to mentally psych myself up each time I make that first jump.) 

I know it sounds incredibly cheesy, but I have to say it because it’s 100% true: I’ve gotten stronger and accomplished more than I ever thought possible.  

I drank the CrossFit Kool-Aid. And let me tell you, it tasted delicious. 

I know that I will never look like Tia-Clair Toomey or Annie Thorisdottir.  There will always be someone in the gym who can lift heavier, who can outperform me on a Metcon. And I still can’t quite manage a real push-up or double-unders.  But honestly, who cares? I’m working hard. I’m getting stronger. And that’s all that matters. 

There are a lot of CrossFit blogs out there. But for those of you who look at pictures of athletes competing in the CrossFit games and see nothing that they can relate to...this one’s for you.  

Because you don’t have to look like them or lift like them. 

You just have to work your ass off.
